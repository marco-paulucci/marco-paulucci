### ðŸŽ® Game Dev Projects ðŸŽ®

<details>
  <summary>Median XL (Released)</summary>

---
  
  Developed and conducted the largest Diablo II mod between 2012 and 2024. I've taken a hiatus since to focus on other projects. This full-conversion ARPG mod provides endless hours of entertainment, deep endgame, and a multiplayer network all over the world with an active trading scene.

  <summary>TCGTracker (Alpha)</summary>

---
  Online web-app to track pokemon TCG cards. Existing trackers did not have certain features that I wanted.
  - Defining custom collections and galleries and seeing them as if they're in your binder.
  - A built-in Pokedex collection which features the most valuable (or your favorite) card for each slot.
  - Seeing your collection as a portfolio and price evolution of your cards/collections.
  - One-click access to find deals for cards you want on cardmarket, tcgplayer or ebay.

I made the project for personal use but I might go the extra mile one day to release it into production.

  **Epic Warriors** (Prototype)
    
MMO Idle RPG/Autobattler developed using Unity and C# backend. It contains basic currencies, online battling, campaign and hero management. The goal of the game was a focus on F2P and "seasons" with much faster progress that resets monthly. [1](src/4.png), [2](src/5.png)

  **Black Realm** (Prototype)
    
A prototype made in Unreal Engine 5 based on Median XL mod for Diablo II. The goal was to dive into UE5 development and become familiar with the tech. It supports multiplayer, and integrates Fortnite's GameplayAbilitySystem. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAKI9IiZJ1A) (note: the video contains 3rd party assets not owned by me).

**Insect Empire** (Prototype)
    
  A prototype of a game where in each level you have an Insectarium. The goal is to beat waves of enemies, bosses and environmental hazards with a horde of your insects. You have various different insects to buy, but you want to balance defense and economy. It's a mix of a clicker/collector and tower defense game. You also have a separate level-agnostic Insectarium (slower to build) with various perks and progression.

  **Click, Boom, Repeat** (Prototype)
    
  A fast-paced action rogue-lite for PC/console where you unleash a variety of spells against endless waves of enemies. Early phase.

  **FlowTrip** (EoL)
    
  Mobile side-scroller developed in 2016 that lived a few years in the Apple Store until it became incompatible. Minimalistic graphics with interesting procedural patterns. It featured much gamification, including leaderboards, skins, trails, and media sharing.
