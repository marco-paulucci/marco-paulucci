  <summary>Median XL</summary>
    
  Developed and conducted the largest Diablo II mod between 2012 and 2024. I've taken a hiatus since to focus on other projects. This full-conversion ARPG mod provides endless hours of entertainment, deep endgame, and a multiplayer network all over the world with an active trading scene.

**TCGTracker**

  Online web-app to track pokemon TCG cards. Existing trackers did not have certain features that I wanted.
  - Defining custom collections and galleries and seeing them as if they're in your binder.
  - A built-in Pokedex collection which features the most valuable (or your favorite) card for each slot.
  - Seeing your collection as a portfolio and price evolution of your cards/collections.
  - One-click access to find deals for cards you want on cardmarket, tcgplayer or ebay.

  **Epic Warriors**
    
MMO Idle RPG/Autobattler developed using Unity and C# backend. It contains basic currencies, online battling, campaign and hero management. The goal of the game was a focus on F2P and "seasons" with much faster progress that resets monthly. It was dropped to work on **Kaline** instead. [1](src/5.png), [2](src/6.png)

  **Black Realm**
    
A prototype made in Unreal Engine 5 based on Median XL mod for Diablo II. The goal was to dive into UE5 development and become familiar with the tech. It supports multiplayer, and integrates Fortnite's GameplayAbilitySystem. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAKI9IiZJ1A) (note: the video contains 3rd party assets not owned by me).

I'm cooking multiple additional prototypes. There are simply too many things I want to work on. However my goal is to release a web game on itch.io in the upcoming months.
